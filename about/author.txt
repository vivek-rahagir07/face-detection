Vivek Yadav aka Rahagir, is a self-driven full-stack developer and product thinker who believes in building real systems under real constraints. His work sits at the intersection of web engineering, AI in the browser, and human-centric design.

Cognito Attend was built as part of an intense 72-hour challenge, with a clear self-imposed rule: no machine-side servers for AI inference, no shortcuts, no black-box APIs.

The result is a fully browser-native biometric system that proves how far modern web technologies can go when pushed to their limits.

Rahagir’s development philosophy is simple:
"If it can run on a browser, it should respect the user, protect their data, and scale without fear."

He focuses on:
> Building privacy-first systems
> Exploring client-side AI feasibility
> Designing products that are technically bold yet practically usable
> Learning by shipping, not by theorizing
