Cognito Attend is not just an attendance system.
It is an experiment, a statement, and a proof of capability.

A proof that AI doesn’t always need heavy servers.
A proof that students & indie developers can build enterprise-grade systems.
A proof that innovation is more about intent than infrastructure.

This project reflects a mindset where limitations are treated as design inputs, not blockers.
